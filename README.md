#PrestaShop Module Skeleton


This is a basic module skeleton for Prestashop; it is a collection of boilerplate code that
should make easier to develop a modern PrestaShop module. It uses Symfony services and some custom
classes developed in order to speed-up common tasks (such as creating SQL queries for object-model tables creation
)

It includes folders, empty ``index.php``s and many utility classes. 
It also includes a ``composer.phar`` to install the required dependencies.
It also comes with some boilerplate code useful to create symfony controllers in your application.

The ``example`` folder contains some practical file example mostly taken from real projects, to be used as bases to be copied when creating a new 
module.

Todo:
- add examples
- add unit tests
